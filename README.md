# CamPhish

CamPhish is a technique to take cam shots of a target’s phone front camera or PC webcam. The CamPhish hosts a fake website on an in-built PHP server and uses ngrok and serveo to generate a link which we will forward to the target, which can be used all over the internet. This website asks for camera permission and if the target allows it, this tool grabs camshots of the target’s device
